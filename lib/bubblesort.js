 * Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort,              |
 * is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps              |
 * through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of             |
 * adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.    |
 * The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, |
 * which indicates that the list is sorted.                         |
